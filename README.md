useful codes to deal with geo ftp


Certainly! The wget command you provided is designed to download all files and directories recursively from a specified FTP directory while preserving a clean directory structure locally. Let's break down each part of the command:

bash
Copy code
wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=5 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE245nnn/GSE245108/
Options Explained:
wget: This is the command-line utility for downloading files from the web.

-r: This stands for "recursive," which tells wget to download directories and their contents recursively. It will follow links and download all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.

-np: This stands for "no parent." It instructs wget not to ascend to the parent directory. This means it will only download files and directories starting from the specified directory and below, and it won't try to download files from directories above the starting point.

-nH: This stands for "no host directories." By default, wget creates directories starting with the hostname of the site you're downloading from (e.g., ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). This option prevents wget from creating those directories, keeping your local directory structure cleaner.

--cut-dirs=5: This option modifies the directory structure of the downloaded files by "cutting" off the first 5 directory levels from the remote URL path. In the specified URL ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE245nnn/GSE245108/, there are 5 directories (ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, geo, series, GSE245nnn, GSE245108). By cutting these directories, the downloaded files will start from the GSE245108 directory level, effectively avoiding the creation of unnecessary parent directories locally.

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE245nnn/GSE245108/: This is the URL of the directory you want to download. wget will start downloading from this URL and follow links to download all files and subdirectories recursively.
